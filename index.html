        <p> As the primary intern on this project, I navigated the development of the web application from start to finish, 
          working closely with occupational therapists to ensure the design aligned with their needs. The application provides 
          a platform for therapists to analyze data from sensors placed within the SmartSeat, helping them monitor patient movements
           and assess the physical health of older adults in real-time. </p> 
        <p> I managed every stage of the process—from the initial design discussions to implementing the frontend interface. 
          Additionally, I built and integrated backend API endpoints, enabling seamless data storage and retrieval in collaboration with InfluxDB. 
          This system allows for smooth communication between the dashboard and the backend, ensuring data can be created, read, updated, 
          and deleted (CRUD) effectively. </p> 
        <p> Throughout the project, I worked independently, taking ownership of both the frontend and backend tasks. My role involved 
          coordinating the technical aspects and ensuring that the dashboard met the expectation of the end users (occupational therapists). </p>

      <section id="features">
        <h1>Features</h1>
        <p> The project uses a login-based system powered by <strong>Firebase</strong>, allowing occupational therapists to securely access the dashboard. 
          Each participant within the system is assigned <strong>unique IDs</strong> linked to key elements: Home, Seats, and Studies. This structure provides 
          a comprehensive framework for therapists to create, update, delete, and manage participants, seats, and related studies directly 
          from the application, with all data stored and synchronized in InfluxDB for long-term access and analysis. </p> 
          <p> The dashboard also includes a data visualization component to display time-series data from sensors installed in each SmartSeat. 
            Therapists can view trends related to movement, <strong>activity levels,</strong> and other metrics over time. Additionally, the system is
             designed to monitor the health status of each seat, such as <strong>battery levels</strong> and data reports. While real-time <strong>synchronization</strong>
             with seat sensors is still under development, temporary data has been integrated to simulate these features, ensuring the 
             interface is functional for future live synchronization.
             </p>

      <section id="development">
        <h1>Development</h1>
        <p> When I was introduced to the concept at the start of the internship, I began by creating <strong>wireframes</strong> and a 
          <strong>low-fidelity prototype</strong> of the dashboard. This was essential for facilitating conversations with the 
          end users occupational therapists to understand their needs, explore potential features, and define the <strong>end goal</strong> 
          of the project. Since this is a <strong>research-focused program</strong>, the initial design was not set in stone. We 
          adopted an <strong>iterative process</strong>, refining the dashboard design through continuous feedback and experimentation 
          to ensure it aligned with the therapists' expectations. </p> 
          <p> Following the design phase, I independently took on the development of the dashboard’s <strong>frontend components</strong> and 
            features to bring the app to life. During this phase, I collaborated with stakeholders to gather examples and insights on how we
            wanted to <strong>visualize</strong> the data effectively. This feedback guided the creation of interactive and meaningful 
            visual components for the dashboard while keeping reactivity across all screen types. </p> 
            <p> On the backend, I developed the Flask API to manage the <strong>CRUD operations</strong> for key elements such as 
              Home, Participant, Seat, and Study IDs. These operations ensured seamless communication between the dashboard and InfluxDB, 
              where all relevant data is stored and accessed. </p> 
              <p> Currently, I am working on graphing and visualizing data using historical trial data stored in InfluxDB. These 
                visualizations are being integrated with Grafana to embed interactive graphs into the dashboard, allowing users to
                 analyze seat performance, movement patterns, and health metrics. The goal is to prepare the system for
                  live synchronization with the sensors, ensuring the dashboard reflects real-time data and insights once the 
                  integration is complete. </p>      </section>

      <section id="improvements">
        <h1>Future Improvements</h1>
        <p> The next phase of the project involves <strong>optimizing</strong> the embeded graphs and visualizations displayed on the dashboard.
          We are currently using previously collected trial data from the database to ensure the visual elements are clear, informative, 
          and user-friendly. This step is crucial to provide actionable insights for occupational therapists as they monitor patient 
          progress and seat performance. </p> 
         <p> Once the studies go live, the system will transition to synchronizing real-time data from the deployed seats. This will
            ensure the dashboard reflects the most up-to-date information on sensor readings, battery levels, and patient movement. 
            We aim to maintain an ongoing dialogue with occupational therapists throughout this phase to ensure the data integration 
            meets their needs. </p> 
         <p> Additionally, I will assist therapists with onboarding and setup to ensure they can effectively use the system. This continuous 
           support will help address any challenges they encounter and allow us to gather feedback for further refinement and improvements as 
           the project evolves. </p>
